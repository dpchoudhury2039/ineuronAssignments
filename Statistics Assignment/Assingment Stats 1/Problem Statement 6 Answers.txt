Interpretation
Gaurav:
Highest probability of solving exactly 6 questions correctly, indicating he often solves a majority due to his high correction rate.

Barakha:
Highest probability of solving exactly 6 questions correctly, showing that she achieves better results as the average number of attempts is higher, compensating for her lower correction rate.
Both Students:
The probability of solving exactly 5 questions correctly is significant but not the peak for either student.

Governing Factors
The two main factors affecting their ability to solve questions correctly are:

1. Correction Rate: The probability of solving each question correctly.
2. Number of Questions Attempted: More attempts can balance a lower correction rate and vice versa.
